Install using npm:

## Usage

```js
var resizabull = require('resizabull'),
    element = document.getElementById('resize-me'),
    resizer = resizabull(element);
```

## Available Options

#### `options.onResizeStart(resizer)`

Callback fired when a resize event has begun, receiving the `resizer` instance
itself as an argument.

#### `options.onResize(resizer)`

Callback fired when a resize has started and an edge has been moved, receiving
the `resizer` instance itself as an argument.

#### `options.onResizeStop(resizer)`

Callback fired when a resize event has ended, receiving the `resizer` instance
itself as an argument.

#### `options.threshold` (default: 5)

Tolerance, in pixels, for how far the mouse cursor may be from the edge of a
resizable element before the edge becomes draggable.

#### `options.minDims` (default: { x:0, y:0 })

Minimum allowed dimensions to resize to. Both `x` and `y` must be specified.

#### `options.maxDims`
#### (default: { x: Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, y: Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER })

Maximum allowed dimensions to resize to. Both `x` and `y` must be specified.

## Methods

The `resizabull` method returns a "resizer" instance with a number of methods:

#### `resizer#bindEvents()`

Method to add needed event listeners associated with the given __resizabull__
instance to the DOM.

NOTE: This method does not need to be called on newly instantiated resizers;
this is done automatically.

#### `resizer#unbindEvents()`

Method to remove all event listeners associated with the given __resizabull__
instance from the DOM.
